# deepFRI binaries
deepFRI model binaries for using the deepFRI protocol within Rosetta proper.  These need to be in the Rosetta database, in `database/protocol_data/tensorflow_graphs/tensorflow_graph_repo_submodule/deepFRI`.

## History

* deepFRI was developed by Vlad Gligorijevic, Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute in 2020.  It uses an LSTM and a graph convolutional neural network to predict protein function from sequence and structure. 
* The deepFRI binaries were added to the Rosetta Tensorflow models repository on 27 April 2021 by Vikram K. Mulligan, Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute.
